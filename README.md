# Quantitative EDA on Large-Cap Tech Equities

A structured exploratory data analysis pipeline for AAPL, GOOG, and MSFT that cleanly ingests price and volume data, computes and visualizes key metrics, uncovers seasonal and risk patterns, estimates market betas, and assembles a comprehensive feature matrix for downstream modeling or backtesting.

## Overview

1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**  
   • Downloaded daily OHLC and volume via Yahoo Finance  
   • Handled missing data, aligned business-day indices  
2. **Descriptive Statistics & Returns**  
   • Computed simple vs. log returns  
   • Generated summary tables (mean, σ, quantiles)  
3. **Time-Series Visualizations**  
   • Price vs. 20-day moving average  
   • Rolling 20-day annualized volatility  
   • Max drawdowns & underwater curves  
4. **Correlation & Seasonality**  
   • Return correlation heatmaps  
   • Weekday & month-of-year average returns  
5. **Volume–Return Analysis**  
   • Scatterplots and histograms of volume vs. returns  
   • Quantified correlation between volume spikes and large moves  
6. **CAPM Beta Estimation**  
   • Regressed against S&P 500 to extract α, β, and R² using NumPy’s `polyfit`  
7. **Momentum Indicator**  
   • Computed 14-day RSI to highlight overbought/oversold regimes  
8. **Feature Matrix Construction**  
   • Consolidated all signals (returns, MA, vol, RSI) for modeling
